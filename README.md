# Port-scanner
This is a port scanner,it's not fully developped but it's pretty cool,enjoy !!!
after installing navigate into the directory using cd
all you have to do is type ./port.sh <IP ADDRESS OF THE DEVICE YOU WANT TO SCAN>
  and then wait maybe a few minutes and it will tell you what ports are open
don't worry if it displays this message
"./port.sh: line 2: [192.168.1.25: command not found
Please wait while it is scanning all the open ports..."
  when it displays this it means that it started scanning,i'll try to fix that.
  hope you liked it
